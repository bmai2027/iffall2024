            Texas Hold'em originated in the early 1900s in Robstown, Texas, but remained a regional game for many years. Its popularity grew because it emphasized strategy and decision-making, distinguishing it from other poker games. In 1967, professional players like Crandell Addington, Doyle Brunson, and Amarillo Slim brought Texas Hold'em to Las Vegas, where it slowly gained attention, initially played at the Golden Nugget Casino downtown. Its growth was steady but slow until Benny Binion, a Las Vegas casino owner, introduced it as the main event of the first World Series of Poker (WSOP) in 1970.

        Binion’s decision to host a Texas Hold'em freezeout tournament in the WSOP made the game exciting for both players and spectators, sparking wider interest. By the late 1970s and 1980s, Texas Hold'em gained traction outside Las Vegas, bolstered by influential poker books like Doyle Brunson's *Super/System*, which shared strategic insights and made the game accessible to new players. This period saw a shift in poker culture as more players adopted a strategic approach, solidifying Texas Hold'em's reputation as a game of skill rather than luck.

        The game's popularity exploded in the early 2000s, thanks to the rise of online poker and televised tournaments that used the "hole cam" to reveal players’ cards to viewers. This innovation lets audiences experience the strategic depth of Texas Hold'em, transforming it into a spectator sport. In 2003, an amateur named Chris Moneymaker qualified for the WSOP through a $39 online entry and went on to win the main event, earning $2.5 million. His victory dubbed the "Moneymaker Effect," inspired countless new players and ignited a global poker boom.
