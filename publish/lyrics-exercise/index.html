            Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
            <br>
            Is it that sweet? I guess so
            <br>
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            <br>
            That's that me espresso
            <br>
            Move it up, down, left, right, oh
            <br>
            Switch it up like Nintendo
            <br>
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            <br>
            That's that me espresso

            I can't relate to desperation
            <br>
            My 'give-a-fucks' are on vacation
            <br>
            And I got this one boy, and he won't stop calling
            <br>
            When they act this way, I know I got 'em
        </p>

            Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
            <br>
