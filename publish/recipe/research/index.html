               Chicken Congee 
            </h2>
            <p>
                Congee is indeed a type of rice porridge, popular in many Asian cultures. It's a comforting and simple dish, often enjoyed as a breakfast or light meal. The basic version involves cooking rice in a lot of water or broth until it breaks down into a thick, creamy texture. It can be made savory or sweet and is often served with toppings like green onions, ginger, meats, or vegetables. Congee is a childhood dish that holds a deep and irreplaceable place in my heart, bringing back memories that never grow old. Every time I have it, I’m reminded of the times I used to visit my grandparents' house for breakfast, where the comforting aroma of congee would fill the air, making everything feel warm and familiar. It also takes me back to the bustling energy of dim sum restaurants, where I’d enjoy congee as part of a weekend brunch with family. Despite its simplicity, there's something so soothing and heartwarming about this dish—it’s more than just food. It's a connection to my roots, my family, and those intimate moments of joy and love. For me, congee is like a warm hug for the soul, a dish that brings comfort no matter how many times I’ve had it.

                    Anyway, if you're happy with where your rice is at, start whisking the pot rapidly and constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. This helps speed up our cooking time, and helps break down the rice into smaller, fluffier pieces.

            Egg tarts hold a special place in my childhood, bringing back warm memories of weekend mornings spent with family. I remember the excitement of visiting the local bakery or dim sum restaurant, where the golden, flaky crusts and soft, custardy centers of the egg tarts were a treat I always looked forward to. Biting into one felt like comfort wrapped in layers—both crisp and creamy at the same time. The sweet, delicate taste instantly brings me back to those simple moments of joy, surrounded by loved ones, savoring the warmth and sweetness of home.

            <p> Tong jyun is a dish that brings back cherished memories of Sunday mornings spent in the kitchen with my mom. Every week, we would gather the ingredients, carefully shaping the sticky rice balls and filling them with sweet or savory fillings. The warmth of the kitchen, the comforting aroma of ginger broth simmering on the stove, and the simple joy of sharing this tradition with my mom made it special. It wasn't just about making the dish, but the quiet moments of bonding, laughter, and love that we shared while creating something together. This recipe provides a authntic style of cantonese cooking that I would also help out with as a kid.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wash and soak dried shrimps (1.5 oz) for 10 mins.</li>
                    <li>Dried shiitake mushrooms (2.3 oz) for 15 mins in warm water.</li>
                    <li>Devein fresh shrimps (7.5 oz) and marinate with cornstarch (3 tsp).</li>
                    <li>Once the shiitake mushrooms are fully hydrated, cut them into slices as well as the Chinese sausages (3 piece).</li>
                    <li>Cut the chicken breast (0.75 lb) half length-wise then into thin slices.</li>
                    <li>Marinate with cornstarch (1.5 tbsp), salt (0.75 tsp), and water (3 tbsp).</li>
                    <li>Peel and wash the white radish (3 lb). Cut diagonally in 1/4" slices. Lay the slices down, overlapping slightly, and chop them into strips.</li>
                    <li>Cut the end off napa cabbage (1.5 lb), separate the leaves and wash thoroughly. Cut the stems into 1/2" pieces and continue to chop the rest of the cabbage at 1" pieces.</li>
                    <li>For the carrot (4.5 oz), cut into thin strips.</li>
                    <li>Smash and cut ginger (1.5 piece) and garlic (3 clove).</li>
                    <li>Wash and roughly chop the spring onions (1.5 handful) and cilantro (1.5 handful).</li>
                    <li>Slice the king oyster mushroom (6 oz) into 1/2" slices and cut again into 1/4" strips.</li>
                <br>
                Set all ingredients to the side and make your dough.

                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, add rice flour (3 lb), stir slowly with chopsticks as you drizzle in hot water (24 oz). What you are making is a half-cooked dough. When it is safe to mix with your hands, do so and knead slowly until all the hot water has been mixed in. Add in cold water (12 oz).</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough until well combined and becomes smooth. If the dough feels too soft, add more rice flour.</li>
                    <li>Or if you notice that the dough keeps sticking to your hands in clumps after kneading for a while, add some more rice flour to keep it from sticking to your hands. You can add about 1 oz of rice flour to the bowl with the dough and knead a bit more to make sure that it's dry enough to not stick to your hands but still maintains a slightly sticky consistency.</li>

                    Finally, taste to adjust the flavors of the soup. Turn the heat back to high heat to bring the soup to a boil. Serve the soup piping hot. Serve once it's to your taste! This is usually served in a large serving pot or bowl and everyone can take the amount they want in smaller individual bowls.
