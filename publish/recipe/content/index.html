            The Honk Kong Style Egg Tarts hold a special place in my childhood, bringing back warm memories of weekend mornings spent with grandparents. I remember as a kid visiting the local bakery or dim sum restaurant, where the hot golden and flaky crusts along with the custardy centers of the egg tarts was the best dessert to have for breakfast after a long week at school. Now as an adult, bitting into a egg tart, it surounds me with the feeling of comfort to the happy memories that I would have with my family.

                Step 1:
            </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the pastry, in a large bowl, sift flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add softened butter.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture together with your hands, careful not to knead the pastry dough too much or you will make the pastry tough.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <h2>
                Step 2:
            </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whisk the egg yolks and add the 2 tablespoons of beaten yolk to the flour mixture</li>
                <li> Bring together until smooth. If the dough is too sticky, coating your hands with flour will help.</li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and then refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until the dough is firm.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        </h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the rest of the beaten egg yolk.</li>
            <li> Stir in sugar water and also evaporated milk (if adding vanilla, add now). Stir and combine everything well.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Step 5:
    </h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strain the filling to ensure no lumps. Chill in the refrigerator.</li>

    <li>Take one portion of your dough and roll it into a ball and place in your tart shell.</li>
    <il>Press the shell into the pan with your fingers. Try to make the wrapper uniform in thickness and avoid a thick bottom</il>
    <il>Repeat to finish all.</il>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>

</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pour the custard filling into the shells until it is about 80% full..</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until the surface becomes golden brown and a toothpick can stand in the egg tart.</li>

</p>
<h2>

        I love the style of art in the background as well, the font and the way the frame the images is simple but helps it stand out. This would be great to use when showing images step by step to help guide people through.
